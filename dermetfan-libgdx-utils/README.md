# Versioning #

The version number consists of MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.

- MAJOR is incremented whenever the fuck I want. Resets MINOR to 0.
- MINOR is incremented when backwards-incompatible changes are made. Resets PATCH to 0.
- PATCH is incremented when backwards-compatible changes are made, such as bug fixes or new features.

# Philosophy #

Legacy tends to prevent you from writing the best code possible. Being compatible with previous versions is therefore of low priority.
